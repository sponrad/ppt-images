powerpoint batch image import macro

This is a powerpoint macro that will batch import a directory of images into your powerpoint presentation.

You need to copy the code and place it into a macro inside your powerpoint file. Then run the macro.

What it does
Imports images in the directory of the file, three per slide. They images are resized and positioned within the slide. Images are not placed on the first slide (our title slide).

Assumptions
-the images are in the same directory as the powerpoint file running the macro
-there are enough slides already in the presentation

Feel free to fork and adapt to your situation.
